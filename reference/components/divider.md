# x-divider

Horizontal or vertical separator with optional label. Built from plain Tailwind utilities (no daisyUI `divider`/`divider-*` classes — see CLAUDE.md invariant 6): a flex container split into two line segments with the label rendered between them (line - label - line). `direction="vertical"` produces a vertical line inside a flex row; this prop naming was originally chosen to normalize daisyUI's confusing `divider-horizontal` (which despite its name rendered a *vertical* bar) and is kept for backwards compatibility even though the implementation no longer touches daisyUI CSS.

## When to use

- Visually separating stacked sections (no label, `direction="horizontal"`).
- Splitting two halves of a flex row (`direction="vertical"` inside `<div class="flex">`).
- Labeling the boundary ("OR", "AND", section names) via the default slot.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `direction` | `'horizontal' \| 'vertical'` | `'horizontal'` | Line orientation. `horizontal` = `border-t` line stacked between blocks (root is a flex row). `vertical` = `border-l` line inside a flex row (root is a flex column that stretches to match its siblings' height — see Notes). |
| `color` | `'primary' \| 'secondary' \| 'accent' \| 'neutral' \| 'info' \| 'success' \| 'warning' \| 'error' \| null` | `null` | Tints the line (`border-{color}/30`) and the label text (`text-{color}`). `null` uses `border-base-content/10` / `text-base-content/60`. |
| `position` | `'start' \| 'center' \| 'end'` | `'center'` | Alignment of the label along the line. `start`/`end` shrink the line segment nearest that edge to a fixed `w-4`/`h-4` (was daisyUI's `divider-start`/`divider-end`) so the other segment grows to fill the remaining space; `center` gives both segments equal `flex-1`. |

All other attributes pass through to the root `<div>`.

## Slots

- **default** — optional label content shown inline with the line. Omit for a plain rule.

## Examples

### Basic horizontal

```blade
<x-divider />
```

### Labeled

```blade
<x-divider>OR</x-divider>
<x-divider color="primary">Section break</x-divider>
```

### Position variants

```blade
<x-divider position="start">Start</x-divider>
<x-divider position="end">End</x-divider>
```

### Vertical (inside a flex row)

```blade
<div class="flex h-24">
    <div class="grid place-items-center flex-1">A</div>
    <x-divider direction="vertical">OR</x-divider>
    <div class="grid place-items-center flex-1">B</div>
</div>
```

## Class composition

See [`src/Compose/DividerComposer.php`](../../src/Compose/DividerComposer.php). Returns four keys consumed by the Blade view: `root` (flex container), `lineStart` / `lineEnd` (the two border segments either side of the label — sizes/colors vary with `position`/`color`/`direction`), and `label` (only rendered when the slot is non-empty).

## Related

- [`<x-card>`](./card.md) — uses its own internal header/footer dividers; do not nest `<x-divider>` inside a divided card.
- [`<x-collapse>`](./collapse.md) — visual section split that also toggles.

## Notes

- **No daisyUI classes**: per CLAUDE.md invariant 6, this component never emits `divider`/`divider-*`. It's plain Tailwind (`flex`, `border-t`/`border-l`, `flex-1`/`flex-none`) — see `src/Compose/DividerComposer.php`.
- **`direction` prop naming (historical)**: the original daisyUI-backed implementation inverted `direction="vertical"` to work around daisyUI's own `divider-horizontal` class rendering a *vertical* bar (see `docs/daisyui/pages/daisyui-5-components__2.md`, `divider` section — `direction: divider-vertical, divider-horizontal`). The prop naming is unchanged for backwards compatibility even though the plain-Tailwind implementation no longer touches that class.
- `direction="vertical"` only makes sense inside a parent with `display: flex` along the row axis, and the divider itself needs a height to span. `root` is `flex flex-col items-center self-stretch` — `self-stretch` (not `h-full`) is deliberate: `h-full` (`height: 100%`) fails to resolve against the outer row when the row's own height is indefinite (sized by its tallest content child rather than an explicit height), which silently overrides the row's default `align-items: stretch` and collapses the divider to its own content height, pushing the label above the true vertical midpoint. `self-stretch` forces the stretch behavior explicitly regardless of the outer row's `align-items`.
- `position="center"` gives both line segments equal `flex-1` — passing it is a no-op vs. omitting the prop (safe but redundant).
